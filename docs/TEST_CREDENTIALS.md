## üß™ How to Use Test Credentials

### 1. In React Native App

#### For Login (SignInScreen)

1. Tap the **üß™ Test Credentials** button (only visible in development)
2. Select a test user from the list
3. The mobile number will be automatically filled
4. Tap **Continue** to proceed with OTP

#### For Registration (CreateAccountScreen)

1. Tap the **üß™ Use Test Credentials** button (only visible in development)
2. Select test credentials from the list
3. All form fields will be automatically filled
4. Tap **Send OTP** to proceed

### 2. From Command Line

Run the test script to test all APIs:

```bash
# Install axios if not already installed
npm install axios

# Run the test script
node scripts/test-login-apis.js
```

## üîß API Endpoints Being Tested

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration Init**: `POST /user/register-init`
2. **OTP Verification**: `POST /user/verify-otp`
3. **User Registration**: `POST /user/register`
4. **User Onboarding**: `POST /user/onboarding`

### Login Flow

1. **Login Request OTP**: `POST /user/login/request-otp`
2. **Login Verify OTP**: `POST /user/login/verify-otp`
3. **Get User Profile**: `GET /user/{id}`

## üìã Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration

- Use any mobile number not in the test users list
- Complete the full registration flow
- Test onboarding process

### Scenario 2: Existing User Login

- Use mobile numbers: `9876543210`, `9876543211`, `9876543212`
- Test login with OTP
- Verify profile completion status

### Scenario 3: Incomplete Profile

- Use mobile number: `9876543212`
- Login and verify profile is incomplete
- Test onboarding completion

### Scenario 4: Premium User

- Use mobile number: `9876543211`
- Login and verify starter plan access
- Test plan-specific features

## üéØ Quick Test Commands

### Test Single Endpoint

```bash
# Test registration init
curl -X POST https://utility-apis-49wa.onrender.com/user/register-init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Device-Port: 8081" \
  -H "X-Device-Type: node" \
  -H "X-App-Version: 1.0.0" \
  -d '{
    "businessName": "Test Business",
    "ownerName": "Test Owner",
    "mobileNumber": "9876543299",
    "businessType": "Proprietorship",
    "gstNumber": "99ZZZZZ0000Z1Z5"
  }'
```

### Test OTP Verification

```bash
# Test OTP verification (replace OTP with actual value)
curl -X POST https://utility-apis-49wa.onrender.com/user/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Device-Port: 8081" \
  -H "X-Device-Type: node" \
  -H "X-App-Version: 1.0.0" \
  -d '{
    "mobileNumber": "9876543299",
    "otp": "123456"
  }'
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

### 1. Check API Headers

Ensure your requests include the required headers:

- `X-Device-Port: 8081`
- `X-Device-Type: {platform}`
- `X-App-Version: 1.0.0`

### 2. Monitor Console Logs

The test credentials panel logs all actions to the console for debugging.

### 3. Verify OTP Values

OTP values are generated by the backend and logged to the console during testing.

### 4. Check Network Tab

Use React Native Debugger or Flipper to monitor network requests and responses.

## üö´ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Mobile number already registered"

**Solution**: Use a different mobile number from the test credentials list or use a completely new number.

### Issue: "Invalid OTP"

**Solution**: Check the console for the actual OTP value generated by the backend.

### Issue: "Unauthorized" errors

**Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct access token from the login response.

### Issue: API endpoint not found

**Solution**: Verify the BASE_URL is correct and the endpoint exists in your backend.

## üìù Adding New Test Credentials

To add new test credentials, edit `src/config/testCredentials.ts`:

```typescript
export const TEST_CREDENTIALS: TestCredentials[] = [
  // ... existing credentials
  {
    mobileNumber: '9876543299',
    businessName: 'New Test Business',
    ownerName: 'New User',
    businessType: 'Proprietorship',
    gstNumber: '99ZZZZZ0000Z1Z5',
    otp: '123456',
  },
];
```

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Never commit real credentials** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data in production
3. **Rotate test credentials** regularly during development
4. **Monitor API usage** to prevent abuse of test endpoints

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with the test credentials:

1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify the backend API is running and accessible
3. Ensure all required headers are being sent
4. Test with the command-line script to isolate issues

**Remember**: Test credentials are for development only. Always use proper authentication in production environments.
