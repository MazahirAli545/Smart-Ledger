# Screens Directory Guide

- The [src/screens/](mdc:src/screens) directory contains all the main UI screens for the application.
- The onboarding and authentication-related screens are organized under [src/screens/Auth/](mdc:src/screens/Auth).
- The [OnboardingScreen.tsx](mdc:src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx) file is the entry point for the onboarding flow.
- Each screen is typically a React component responsible for a specific step or feature in the user journey.
- Navigation between screens is managed via React Navigation, with each screen registered in the main navigator (see [App.tsx](mdc:App.tsx)).
